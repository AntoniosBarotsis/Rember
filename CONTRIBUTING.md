# Contributing 

Feel free to open issues with feature requests, ideas or bug reports.

If you want to add a language that is currently unsupported The have a look at [Language.cs](Rember/Models/Language.cs)
and [BuildTool.cs](Rember/Models/BuildTool.cs).

## Bug Fixing

If you want to fix a specific bug be sure to first create an [issue bug report](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rember/issues/new?assignees=AntoniosBarotsis&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).
You can then wait for a maintainer's response (currently just me). Make sure to mention how you are planning on fixing it.

## Adding new Features

Open up a [discussion](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rember/discussions/new) about your idea. If it's something very simple such as
fixing a typo, making a minor refactoring or adding a new supported language then feel free to just skip that and open a PR directly.
