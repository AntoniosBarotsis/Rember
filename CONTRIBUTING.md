## Bug Fixing

If you want to fix a specific bug be sure to first create an [issue bug report](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rember/issues/new?assignees=AntoniosBarotsis&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).
You can then wait for a maintainer's response (currently just me). If you are planning on also implementing the fix yourself then be sure to mention how you are planning on fixing it.

## Adding new Features

Open up a [discussion](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rember/discussions/new) about your idea.
